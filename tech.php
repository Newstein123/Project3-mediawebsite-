        <p>Bitcoin plunged to about $17,749 and ether fell to about $897 at around 4:15 E.T. on Saturday afternoon, as the sell-off in the crypto market accelerates. The world’s two most popular cryptocurrencies are down more than 35% in the past week, as both breach symbolic price barriers. <br><br> Bitcoin bounced back to around $18,955 and ether was trading at about $995 just after 8 p.m. ET. <br><br> The carnage in the crypto market is partly caused by pressure from macroeconomic forces, including spiraling inflation and a succession of Fed rate hikes. We have also seen these blue chip cryptos track equities lower. It doesn’t help that crypto firms are laying off large swaths of employees, and some of the most popular names in the industry are facing solvency meltdowns. <br><br> Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 in November. Ether peaked at $4,891.70 that same month. Bitcoin last traded this low around December 2020. <br><br> Here’s how we got here.</p><br>
        <h2 class="text-primary"><b>MONDAY</b></h2>

        <p>The week started with crypto prices plummeting, and bitcoin falling as much as 17% at one point in the day. It seemed like the crypto winter was here. <br><br> In the chaos, Celsius, a major crypto staking and lending firm, shocked the market when it announced that all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts have been paused due to “extreme market conditions.” In a memo addressed to the Celsius Community, the platform also said the move was designed to “stabilize liquidity and operations.” <br><br> Celsius effectively locked up its $12 billion in crypto assets under management, raising concerns about the platform’s solvency. The news rippled across the crypto industry, reminding some of what happened in May, when a failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project lost $60 billion in value and dragged the wider crypto industry down with it. <br><br> Celsius was known for offering users a yield of up to 18.63% on their deposits. It’s like a product a bank would offer, except with none of the regulatory safeguards. <br><br> Those crazy high yields were what eventually came under scrutiny. <br><br> “This risk certainly seems like it’s just the beginning,” said John Todaro, Needham’s vice president of crypto assets and blockchain research. <br><br> “What I would say is on the decentralized side — a lot of these DeFi protocols, a lot of those positions are over collateralized, so you shouldn’t quite see the underfunding situation that could happen with centralized borrowers and lenders. But that being said, you could still see a lot of liquidations with that collateral being sold off on DeFi protocols,” continued Todaro.</p><br><br>
        <h2 class="text-primary"><b>TUESDAY</b></h2><br>
        <img src="Photos/Technology/bitcoins3.jpg" alt="Bitcoins" class="img-fluid w-75"><br>

        <p>Crypto markets appeared to stabilize on Tuesday, with bitcoin hovering at around $22,000 and ether at around $1,100. <br><br> Investors were assessing the fallout of Celsius, and meanwhile, another crypto firm joined a growing list of companies cutting staff to try to shore up profits. <br><br> Coinbase announced it was laying off nearly a fifth of its workforce due to crypto volatility. The company had previously cut spending and even rescinded job offers in the hopes of stabilizing its business. <br><br> “We had the recent inflation report that came out that I think surprised many folks,” explained President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi. <br><br> “We’ve had Jamie Dimon and others talk about an upcoming economic hurricane and so given what’s happening in the economy, it feels like the most prudent thing to do right now,” continued Choi. <br><br> Crypto companies across the board are looking for ways to cut costs, as investors rotate out of the riskiest assets, pulling down trading volumes. <br><br> Crypto.com recently announced a staff reduction of 260 people, as did Gemini, which said it would lay off 10% of its workforce — a first for the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange and custodian.</p><br><br>
        <h2 class="text-primary"><b>WEDNESDAY</b></h2><br>
        <img src="Photos/Technology/bitcoins4.jpg" alt="Bitcoins" class="img-fluid w-75"><br><br>
        <p>MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor appeared on CNBC Wednesday morning to discuss concerns around his firm, which has made a $4 billion bet on bitcoin. Saylor has said the company doubles as the first and only bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S., so investing in MicroStrategy is the closest you’ll get to a bitcoin spot ETF. <br><br> MicroStrategy has used company debt to purchase bitcoin, and in March, Saylor decided to take another step toward normalizing bitcoin-backed finance when he borrowed $205 million using his bitcoin as collateral — to then buy more of the cryptocurrency. <br><br> “We have $5 billion in collateral. We borrowed $200 million. So I’m not telling people to go out and take a highly leveraged loan. What I am doing, I think, is doing my best to lead the way and to normalize the bitcoin-backed financing industry,” said Saylor, who added that publicly traded crypto miner Marathon Digital also took out a credit line with Silvergate Bank. <br><br> As bitcoin prices tanked this week, investors worried the company would be asked to put up more collateral for its loan, but Saylor said the fears were overblown. <br><br> “The margin call is much ado about nothing,” Saylor told CNBC earlier this week. “It’s just made me Twitter famous, so I appreciate that...We feel like we have a fortress balance sheet, we’re comfortable, and the margin loan is well managed.” <br><br> Then on Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point in its most aggressive hike since 1994. The Fed said the move was made in an effort to curb sky-high inflation. <br><br> Crypto prices initially rallied on the news as investors hoped we could avoid a recession, but that rally was short-lived.</p><br><br>
        <h2 class="text-primary"><b>THURSDAY</b></h2><br>
        <img src="Photos/Technology/bitcoins5.jpg" alt="Bitcoins" class="img-fluid w-75"><br><br>
        <p>We were back in the red on Thursday. Bitcoin fell to around $20,000, to prices it hadn’t seen since the end of 2020. <br><br> The losses were closely tied to a sell-off on Wall Street, in which the Dow fell 700 points to its lowest level in more than a year. <br><br> It appears that investors can’t shake the fears of recession, and some say it could take time for cryptocurrencies to recover from the sell-off in riskier assets. <br><br> “I think that we’re in a long drawdown period here,” Jill Gunter, Espresso Systems co-founder & chief strategy officer, told CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. <br><br> “I think that we’ve taken the elevator down, and I think that we, as an industry, are going to have to take the stairs back up and climb out by building real utility,” she said. <br><br> Gunter said that, in many ways, what we’re seeing is a “healthy washout.” <br><br> “One doesn’t want to, as a builder, as an investor for the long-term... be in a market where it’s being driven by just short-term price action, by speculation, as, let’s be honest, the crypto market has been largely over the last couple of years,” continued Gunter.</p><br><br>
        <h2 class="text-primary"><b>FRIDAY into SATURDAY</b></h2><br>
        <img src="Photos/Technology/bitcoins6.jpg" alt="Bitcoins"><br><br>
        <p>Carnage in the crypto markets shows no signs of slowing down, as bitcoin and ether continue their sell-off at a rapid clip on Saturday afternoon. <br><br> This comes as crypto hedge funds and businesses face growing questions about insolvency. <br><br> “We had financial instability because of this opaque leverage, you just couldn’t tell where all these risks were building up,” Paxos CEO & Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla told CNBC. <br><br> “In some ways, this is just an age old story. You’re borrowing short and lending long. And I think it’s really unfortunate that people lost money, and I think it will, in some ways, set back the space, because you will lose some early adopters or some of the people who just came in new to the space,” continued Cascarilla. <br><br> But Cascarilla also says that investors are still looking for quality crypto investments. <br><br> “The fundamental technology here and the adoption curve that we see, the institutions that are coming in, how you can get your financial system to operate at the speed of the internet, those are things that need to happen,” he said.</p>

        <h1><b>Inflation and recession fears are squeezing some industries more than others</b></h1><br><hr>
        <p class="text-primary"><b>Key Points</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Shoppers are feeling the pressure as inflation pushes up prices for gas, groceries and a range of other goods and services.</li><br>
                <li>Airlines, movie theaters and specialty retailers are among the businesses that so far say they’ve been shielded from a slowing economy.</li><br>

        <span><small>A woman pushes a shopping cart through the grocery aisle at Target in Annapolis, Maryland, on May 16, 2022, as Americans brace for summer sticker shock as inflation continues to grow.</small></span><br><hr>
        <p class="p-5">People still appear willing to shell out to travel, go to the movies and have a drink or two, even as surging prices and fears of a recession have them pulling back in other areas. <br><br> How people spend their money is shifting as the economy slows and inflation pushes prices higher everywhere including gas stations, grocery stores and luxury retail shops. The housing market, for example, is already feeling the pinch. Other industries have long been considered recession proof and may even be enjoying a bump as people start going out again after hunkering down during the pandemic. <br><br> Still, shoppers everywhere are feeling pressured. In May, an inflation metric that tracks prices on a wide range of goods and services jumped 8.6% from a year ago, the biggest jump since 1981. Consumers’ optimism about their finances and the overall economy sentiment fell to 50.2% in June, its lowest recorded level, according to the University of Michigan’s monthly index. <br><br> As gas and food prices climb, Brigette Engler, an artist based in New York City, said she’s driving to her second home upstate less often and cutting back on eating out. <br><br> “Twenty dollars seems extravagant at this point for lunch,” she said. <br><br> Here’s a look at how different sectors are faring in the slowing economy.</p><br><br>
        <h2><b>Movies, experiences holding up</b></h2><br>
        <p class="p-5">Concerts, movies, travel and other experiences people missed during the height of the pandemic are among the industries enjoying strong demand. <br><br> Live Nation Entertainment, which owns concert venues and Ticketmaster, hasn’t seen people’s interest in attending concerts wane yet, CEO Joe Berchtold said at the William Blair Growth Stock Conference earlier this month. <br><br> In movie theaters, blockbusters like “Jurassic World: Dominion” and “Top Gun: Maverick” have also pulled in strong box office sales. The movie industry long been considered “recession proof,” since people who give up on pricier vacations or recurring Netflix subscriptions can often still afford movie tickets to escape for a few hours. <br><br> Alcohol is another category that’s generally protected from economic downturns, and people are going out to bars again after drinking more at home during the early days of the pandemic. Even as brewers, distillers and winemakers raise prices, companies are betting that people are willing to pay more for better-quality alcohol. <br><br> “Consumers continue to trade up, not down,” Molson Coors Beverage CEO Gavin Hattersley said on the company’s earnings call in early May. It might seem counterintuitive, but he said the trend is in line with recent economic downturns. <br><br> Alcohol sales have also been shielded in part because prices haven’t been rising as quickly as prices for other goods. In May, alcohol prices were up roughly 4% from a year ago, compared with the 8.6% jump for overall consumer price index. <br><br> Big airlines like Delta, American and United are also forecasting a return to profitability thanks to a surge in travel demand. Consumers have largely digested higher fares, helping airlines cover the soaring cost of fuel and other expenses, although domestic bookings have dipped in the last two months. <br><br> It isn’t clear whether the race back to the skies will continue after the spring and summer travel rushes. Business travel usually picks up in the fall, but airlines might not be able to count on that as some companies look for ways to curb expenses and even announce layoffs. <br><br> People’s desire to get out and socialize again is also boosting products like lipstick and high heels that were put away during the pandemic. That recently helped sales at retailers including Macy’s and Ulta Beauty, which last month boosted their full-year profit forecasts. <br><br> Luxury brands such as Chanel and Gucci are also proving to be more resilient, with wealthier Americans not as affected by climbing prices in recent months. Their challenges have been more concentrated in China of late, where pandemic restrictions persist. <br><br> But the fear is that this dynamic could change quickly, and these retailers’ short-term gains could evaporate. More than eight in 10 U.S consumers are planning to make changes to pull back on their spending in the next three to six months, according to a survey from NPD Group, a consumer research firm. <br><br> “There is a tug-of-war between the consumer’s desire to buy what they want and the need to make concessions based on the higher prices hitting their wallets,” said Marshal Cohen, chief retail industry advisor for NPD.</p><br><br>
        <h2><b>Homes, big-ticket items squeezed</b></h2><br>
        <p class="p-5">The once red-hot housing market is among those clearly hurting from the slowdown. <br><br> Rising interest rates have dampened mortgage demand, which is now roughly half of what it was a year ago. Homebuilder sentiment has dropped to the lowest level in two years after falling for six consecutive months. Real estate firms Redfin and Compass both announced layoffs earlier this week. <br><br> “With May demand 17% below expectations, we don’t have enough work for our agents and support staff,” Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman wrote in an email to employees later posted on the company’s website. <br><br> For the retail sector more broadly, data from the Commerce Department also showed a surprising 0.3% drop in overall in May from the previous month. That included declines at online retailers and miscellaneous store retailers such as florists and office suppliers. <br><br> And while demand for new and used cars remains strong, auto industry executives are starting to see signs of potential trouble. With the cost for new and used vehicles up by double digits over the last year, car and other motor vehicle dealers saw sales decline 4% decline in May from the previous month, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. <br><br> Ford Motor CFO John Lawler said this week that delinquencies on car loans are starting to tick up too. Although the increase could signal tough times ahead, he said said it’s not yet a worry, since delinquencies had been low. <br><br> “It seems like we’re reverting back more towards the mean,” Lawler said at a Deutsche Bank conference. <br><br> The restaurant industry is also seeing signs of potential trouble, although how eateries are affected could vary. <br><br> Fast-food chains have also traditionally fared better in economic downturns since they’re more affordable and draw diners with promotional deals. Some restaurant companies are also betting people will keep dining out as long as grocery prices rise faster. <br><br> The cost of food away from home rose 7.4% over the 12 months ended in May, but prices for food at home climbed even faster, shooting up 11.9%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Restaurant Brands International CEO Jose Cil and Wendy’s CEO Todd Penegor are among the fast-food executives who have emphasized the gap as an advantage for the industry. <br><br> But McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in early May that low-income consumers have started ordering cheaper items or shrinking the size of their orders. As the largest U.S. restaurant chain by sales, it’s often seen as a bellwether for the industry. <br><br> On top of that, traffic across the broader restaurant industry slowed to its lowest point of the year in the first week of June, according to market research firm Black Box Intelligence. That was after the number of visits also slowed in May, though sales ticked up 0.7% on higher spending per visit. <br><br> Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein also said in a research note on Friday that restaurants are accelerating discounting, a sign that they’re expecting same-store sales growth to slow. Among the chains that have introduced new deals to draw diners are Domino’s Pizza, which is offering half-price pizzas, and Wendy’s, which brought back its $5 Biggie Bag meal. <br><br> Among those scrambling to adjust to a shift in shopper behavior are mass-merchant retailers like Target and Walmart, which issued cautious guidance for the year ahead. <br><br> Target warned investors earlier this month that its fiscal second-quarter profits would take a hit as it discounts people bought up during the pandemic but no longer want, such as small appliances and electronics. The big-box retailer is trying to make room on its shelves for the products in demand now: beauty products, household essentials and back-to-school supplies. <br><br> CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC that the company’s stores and website are still seeing strong traffic and “a very resilient customer” overall, despite the shift in their buying preferences. Rival Walmart has also been discounting less-desired items like apparel, although the retail giant said it’s been gaining share in grocery as shoppers look to save.</p>
