        <img src="Photos/Sports/lukamodric.jpg" alt="A Photo of Luka Modric" class="img-fluid"><br><br>
        <p>There are many different types of central midfielders meaning you can learn inspirational styles from a range
            of midfield footballers. The diversity of skills required to master the role make it extremely competitive
            amongst players. <br> There are action-based players like <b>Paul Pogba</b> who always wants the ball and
            drives
            their team on. Players like <b>Andres Iniesta</b>, who constantly wants the ball only needing one touch or
            one pass
            to cause havoc for the opposition. <b>Steven Gerrard</b> could hit a shot from 35 yards with unnerving
            accuracy and
            <b>N’Golo Kante</b> will steal the ball from the opposition and turn defence into attack in seconds. These
            are just
            some examples to highlight the diversity of players that you can learn from to become a great central
            midfielder. <br><br> Despite the variety of the role, there are some tips that every great central
            midfielder needs to remember. We’ve put together a list of tips to help you master the role and show the
            power of <b>Pogba</b> and the incision of <b>Iniesta</b>.</p>

                <h3 class="text-success">ALWAYS BE ON THE MOVE</h3>
                <img src="Photos/Sports/iniesta.jpg" alt="A Photo of Andreas Iniesta" class="img-fluid"><br><br>
                <p>
                    The middle of the pitch can be the most crowded area, which can make it difficult to get on the
                    ball at all – let alone in time and space. The best central midfielders are those who are always
                    on the move, becoming a nightmare for the opposition to mark and popping up in pockets of
                    space which they’ve spotted but the other team haven’t thought to cover.
                    Don’t just focus on where the ball is but think about where it needs to go and how you can
                    create new attacks for your team. What you do when you don’t have the ball is almost as
                    important as what you do with it.

                        <span>Vision is a skill to master. While there are creative and visionary players who can see
                            things that
                            others do not, there are many ways in which you can improve your own vision.The most basic
                            is by
                            playing with your head up. Scan the horizon all the time, especially when you don’t have the
                            ball. You might notice that three of the opposition’s defence are positioned on the right
                            and so if you receive possession, you’ll know to switch the play to the space that has
                            created out on the left. The ability to spot gaps and openings is a massive weapon for a
                            central midfielder to have, and it all comes from keeping your head up.</span>

            <li>
                <h3 class="text-success">MASTER YOUR FIRST TOUCH</h3>
                <img src="Photos/Sports/ozil.jpg" alt="A Photo of Ozil" class="img-fluid"><br><br>
                <p>
                    A good first touch is vital anywhere on the pitch, but it’s even more important in central midfield.
                    Being able to control the ball effectively will give you more time to work when the football is in
                    your possession. A bad first touch will allow the opposition to close you down quicker or may
                    result in you surrendering possession completely, putting your team under pressure.

                <p>
                    How often do we hear the phrase “guilty of overplaying” with football on television? Don’t be afraid
                    to shoot if you get a sight of the goal in a good position. Some of the best midfielders in the
                    world are considered so because of their value when it comes to chipping in with goals – if you
                    don’t shoot, you aren’t going to score.
                </p> <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="text-success">KEEP IT SIMPLE AND STAY COMPOSED</h3>
                <p>
                    You need a good range of passing to be a great central midfielder, but the most important pass you
                    can play is the simple one. 60-yard raking balls and switching the play from one flank to the other
                    may look spectacular, but they are a risk even for the best players in the world. <br> Keeping it
                    simple is often the best choice. You’re less likely to surrender possession with short and sharp
                    passes since they force the opposition to chase the ball– therefore creating fatigue and potential
                    openings for you to exploit. If it works for the coaching legend Pep Guardiola, it should work for
                    you!

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="text-success">LEARN ABOUT YOUR TEAMMATES</h3>
                <p>
                    A central midfielder has more connections with their team than any other player. A central
                    midfielder is at the heart of everything and plays a key role. It’s the position that threads
                    defence with attack and left with right. Therefore, knowing everything about your teammates is
                    important. <br> If you know you’ve got a defender who is comfortable playing the ball out, then you
                    can drop short to give and receive it from them with confidence. If your striker likes to play on
                    the shoulder of the last defender, you know that they’ll always be anticipating a through ball to
                    run onto. <br> Developing relationships with the 10 other players on the pitch and every member of
                    your squad will help you to become a great central midfielder.
                </p> <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="text-success">REPETITION AND SELF-DISCIPLINE</h3>
                <p>
                    Becoming a great central midfielder is difficult, but with hard work, practice and a focus on
                    self-development, it is achievable. The position is extremely competitive and even the professionals
                    consistently find ways to improve their performance. A top central midfielder will play a key role
                    in the success of their team. As with any sport, practice is integral to development– so finding the
                    time to play match football will be key to becoming the best central midfielder that you can be.

        <br><br>
        <p>Baseball has never been very popular in Europe due to a few reasons. Despite huge coverage in the USA and always showing up near the top of most people’s favourite sports lists, it has never really gathered much of a serious fan base across the Atlantic. People who wish to play face challenges from other popular sports, and people who wish to watch the MLB in America face a few obstacles. <br>
            While there is an organized season schedule with regularly held games, fans can find it hard to get involved. Awkward time differences of games being held all over a massive country can put off the most avid supporter. Sports held and broadcasted in Europe make for much more easy participation from the people. So, if viewing is so difficult, is it possible at some stage that Europeans may grow to play and love this game that Americans love so much?</p><br><br>

            <p>Europeans love a wide variety of sports, and different sports are more popular than others depending on the region. It’s fair to say that similar to being globally popular, soccer gets the nod here as the number one sport. In recent years soccer has been growing in popularity in America, however, it may be a while before it passes baseball. Basketball, another big sport in the USA, has a firm foothold in Europe, played and enjoyed in most countries. <br> Sports like tennis also have a big following in Europe, and there have been quite a few top American players involved over the years. Cricket seems to be mostly played in England and amongst other reasons this makes it hard for baseball to make a breakthrough there. But being a good team sport, there is plenty of room for expansion throughout Europe. The list of rival sports could go on and on.</p><br><br>
            <h3 class="text-success">WHERE ARE BASEBALL’S ROOTS?</h3><br>
            <p>A lot of these sports have some sort of roots in Europe and thus have been around for quite some time. While baseball seems to hold very little interest in Europe, it is believed to have developed from the English game Rounders. Americans appear to have made some tweaks to the game, thus developing their form, known as baseball. It went as far as having a commission of inquiry to try and discover the true beginnings of baseball. <br> It appears that countries which seem to have taken baseball to their hearts have some sort of connection to America, taking in colonisation, invasion or just general lifestyle influence as a few factors to take into account. This has resulted in the game being mostly played in the continents of the Americas, including the Caribbean area. It also seems to have made its way to the Far East, with Taiwan, South Korea and Japan seeing interest in the game.</p><br><br>
            <h3 class="text-success">A NOTORIOUS MOMENT</h3><br>
            <p>
                A betting scandal over 100 years ago still resounds to this day. It very much affected the reputation of baseball and cast serious doubt on the honesty of the sport. Players were involved with gamblers in an attempt to fix the result of the biggest game in baseball, the World Series. Known as the 1919 Black Sox Scandal, it resulted in court cases and lifetime bans from the sport as the truth emerged. <br> Europeans don’t like the idea of a sport being tampered with and this was just the start of a long list of bad moments in baseball. It is not the easiest game to bet on but with many people liking to have a wager at online casinos, the prospect of games being rigged does not fill them with trust.

    <div class="container-fluid d-flex p-5 bg-secondary bg-opacity-25">
        <div class="container w-25">
            <img src="Photos/Sports/LebronJames.jpg" alt="Lebron James (Highest paid NBA player)" class="w-100"><br>
            <p>Lebron James (Highest Paid NBA Player)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container w-50">
            <p class="smfont">Everyone knows that NBA players make a lot of money. The NBA has some of the highest-paid athletes in the world with an average player salary of $6 million per season. <br><br> Players like James Lebron and Kevin Durant are the highest-paid in the league due to their skills and value-added to their team. Steph Curry had a salary of $37 million in the 2018-2019 season, and by the end of the 2021-2022 season, it will be $45 million. <br><br> Their lifestyles, big contracts, and even yearly salaries are all easily accessible by anyone with Google. However, as much as people know about what pro athletes get paid, few understand just how they get paid. <br><br>
            Below, I will look at the entire payment process for NBA athletes. That will reveal how all different players get their checks, the reasons the system exists in the way that it does, as well as why they get paid in the way they do.</p><br>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid bg-secondary bg-opacity-25 p-5">
        <h3 class="text-danger">How Do NBA Players Get Paid?</h3>
        <p>Every NBA player, from a max contract superstar to a modest bench player, starts with a salary. Once that occurs, they are guaranteed access to that money thanks to a clause in the Collective Bargaining Agreement that says they get paid no matter what happens in the regular season. <br><br> They receive their money in the form of either checks or direct deposit (based on their preference) and it comes straight from the organization. The current Bargaining Agreement allows for this transaction, which cuts down on any extra confusion.</p><br>
        <h3 class="text-danger">How Often Do NBA Players Get Paid?</h3>
        <p>While being an NBA player may not be a job in the most conventional sense, they do get their paychecks like most other jobs in America. That means twice a month, or every two weeks. In that way, they do not get paid on a weekly basis. They typically have to wait for every other. <b>However, in some special cases, players can receive money in a slightly different way.</b>Sometimes that’s due to external factors, but irregularities mostly occur when a player receives exceptional circumstances pay. That includes things like signing bonuses, loans, or advances. <br><br> If a player does get an advance for one reason or another, they can only receive it after July during the season they requested it. Minimum salary players have a cap on how much they can earn in that way.</p><br>
        <h3 class="text-danger">Do NBA Players Only Get Paid During the Season?</h3>
        <p>As surprising as it might seem, NBA players do not stop getting paid once the season ends. While it might be intuitive to think they would only receive their money during their time on the court, that could not be further from the truth. Rather, NBA players continue to get their bi-weekly checks throughout the entire year. It makes much more sense for the organization as a whole because they have more time to secure the money. It also gives the players a more set schedule and knowledge of what to expect.</p><br>
        <h3 class="text-danger">What Do NBA Players Earn for Playoff Games?</h3>
        <p>Another factor to consider when it comes to NBA payments, is the playoffs. Obviously, not every team goes to the postseason. As such, playoff games are not added into initial salaries. Rather, the NBA designates a small pool of money that the teams can divvy up among their players. While the amount is typically small, an extra bonus is always nice. Some players might also have a playoff incentive in their contract, which can cause them to earn a little bit more. In these cases,<b>postseason players get a game-by-game paycheck rather than a standard one.</b></p><br>
        <h3 class="text-danger">Do NBA Players Get Signing Bonuses?</h3>
        <p>Athletes, especially NBA players, have plenty of ways to raise their initial contract. While endorsement deals and extensions both do a good job at that, they are also able to earn more money through signing bonuses. <br><br> A signing bonus is a lump sum that an athlete can earn when they first sign their contract. Such a bonus can never be tied to a renegotiation, but it is a key part of many athletes’ deals. It can act as an incentive to join a team or help shore up other parts of the contract. In the NBA, a signing bonus can be no more than 15 percent of a player’s total contract. <br> Typically, only big name players get signing bonuses. However, due to the salary cap or external situations, lower level players can collect them from time to time. Rookies with a lot of promise, such as high draft picks, can earn a big bonus too.</p><br>
        <h3 class="text-danger">How Much Do NBA Players Taxed?</h3>
        <p>Taxes for NBA players, due to the nature of their job, are not straightforward. First, they have to take into account where they live, then they have to take into account the so-called “jock tax” they get from being in the league. Every player in the NBA pays a federal tax on their salary. If they make the league minimum, they pay in the second-highest tax bracket. If they make more than $1 million, they pay into the highest. They then pay their state taxes based on where they live (not where they play). <br> After that’s done, everyone in the league is subject to a 3 percent “jock tax” that exists to charge people who earn money in a state but do not live there. Once everything gets tallied up, athletes then get whatever’s left.</p><br>
        <h3 class="text-danger">Final Words</h3>
        <p>Figuring out the way NBA players get their money is not as simple or as straightforward as it might seem. Their payment schedules are tricky, the taxes can be tough to discern, and it can be hard to figure out the way incentives, injuries, or bonuses play into everything. <br><br> <b><span class="text-secondary">The NBA has an organized system of issuing out payments to players. Players are paid through paychecks and those who are willing to get an advance can negotiate that in their contracts. Signing bonuses are also offered to motivate players to join certain teams.</span></b> On the 1st day and 15th day of each month, each player gets a certain amount of money according to the terms dictated on their contracts. <br><br> Still, once you understand the basics, it’s easy to see how all of the pieces work together. Everything in the NBA is calculated. The way the players receive their payments is yet another example of that.</p>
