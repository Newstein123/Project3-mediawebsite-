        <h1>Does the Smallpox Vaccine Protect Against Monkeypox?</h1><br>
        <h3 class="text-secondary"><i>The U.S. government has a large stockpile of vaccines that protect against smallpox and monkeypox—but immunization likely won't be available (or necessary) for everyone.</i></h3>

        <p><i>Fact checked on June 2, 2022 by Vivianna Shields, a journalist and fact-checker with experience in health and wellness publishing.</i><br><br> As cases of monkeypox continue to spread across the globe, people have shifted their questioning from "What is it?" to "How can I protect myself?" And as it turns out, some older people in the U.S. may still be somewhat protected from the virus due to a prior vaccination: the smallpox vaccine. <br><br> "Vaccination against smallpox also protects against monkeypox," Hannah Newman, MPH, director of epidemiology at Lenox Hill Hospital, told Health. "People who were vaccinated against smallpox years ago may have some immunity, or at least have some protection against milder illness if infected." <br><br> The U.S. officially stopped routine smallpox vaccination in 1972, after the disease was eradicated, but because of concern for bioterrorism, the government has a large stockpile of the smallpox vaccine—enough to vaccinate all Americans who would need protection, should a future outbreak occur. <br><br> So what does this all mean for the current uptick in monkeypox cases? How much protection does a previous smallpox vaccination give to older adults at risk of monkeypox? And how does the U.S. plan to distribute these vaccines for the current outbreak? Here's what to know.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Childhood Smallpox Vaccination and Monkeypox Protection</h2><br>
        <p>According to Newman, people who received the smallpox vaccine prior to its discontinuation in 1972 likely still have some protection against the related monkeypox virus and other orthopoxviruses—it's just not entirely clear how much. <br><br> A 2007 study published in the journal Clinical and Vaccine Immunology found that prior childhood smallpox vaccination doesn't provide complete protection against monkeypox—but it does provide partial protection. Researchers also found that, in those previously vaccinated against smallpox, those who still contracted monkeypox experienced reduced disease severity. <br><br> "Clearly protection does wane," William Schaffner, MD, professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Health. "How much, and certainly how much against monkeypox, we don't know."</p><br><br>
        <h2>Current Vaccines Offer Protection Against Smallpox and Monkeypox</h2><br>
        <p>There are two different smallpox vaccines that the U.S. has in its stockpile that are either also approved or could be helpful against monkeypox: ACAM2000 and Jynneos. Both have been licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—ACAM2000 in 2007 and Jynneos in 2019. <br><br> Neither of those vaccines were the specific ones used when smallpox vaccination was mandatory during the 2oth century, according to Newman. But ACAM2000 replaces Dryvax, which was licensed by the FDA in 1931 and uses the same kind of virus to create an immune response. <br><br> The ACAM2000 vaccine doesn't contain variola virus (the virus that causes smallpox), but it does contain live vaccinia virus, which is in the poxvirus family and is related to variola virus. The vaccine is approved for those who are 18 and older and at high risk for orthopoxviruses (right now, that includes people in laboratories working with orthopoxviruses and military personnel), but can be used in people exposed to monkeypox, if needed. <br><br> The vaccine is different from typical vaccines in that it doesn't include an injection. Instead, the vaccine is administered by a two-pronged (bifurcated) needle dipped in vaccine solution that then pricks the upper arm. A small, red, itchy, sore spot (known as a "pock") develops at the vaccination site, which indicates a successful vaccination. The spot will then turn into a blister, then a scab, and leaves behind a scar. <br><br> Jynneos is the newer vaccine that has been licensed in the U.S. to prevent both monkeypox and smallpox. Like ACAM2000, Jynneos is also made from the vaccinia virus, but in a modified form called "Modified Vaccinia Ankara." It's non-replicating, meaning it can't reproduce in human cells, and it doesn't cause disease. The vaccine is meant for people ages 18 and older who are at a higher risk of orthopoxviruses, and is given in two doses, four weeks apart. <br><br> Vaccine Effectiveness and CDC Recommendations. <br><br> According to the CDC, the smallpox vaccine is at least 85% effective in preventing monkeypox, according to past data from Africa. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of Jynneos against monkeypox was concluded from the vaccine's immunogenicity—or its ability to provoke an immune response—and effectiveness based on animal trials. <br><br> While there is a large quantity of the ACAM2000 vaccine available—more than 100 million doses—there is significantly less availability of the Jynneos vaccine, with just over 1,000 doses in the stockpile currently, though they're expected to increase. <br><br> In a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) published by the CDC on May 27, the agency accepted recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to make Jynneos available to those at high risk of exposure and infection—that can mean people who study monkeypox in labs, as well as health care workers who, right now, may be dealing with the current outbreak. <br><br> The CDC is also beginning to mobilize the vaccine for monkeypox in light of the increase in cases, by focusing on those who have been directly exposed. "Right now, while we are in the early phase of investigating this, we know that those at highest risk for infection are those who had contact with a known monkeypox patient," Jennifer McQuinston, DVM, MS, a veterinarian and deputy director of the CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, told CNN. "So those are the individuals we're really focusing on recommending vaccination for right now: post-exposure vaccination."<br><br> This strategy is also known as a "ring vaccination," in which direct contacts of confirmed monkeypox patients are vaccinated. "At the time, the vaccine is available through public health for people who have had contact with confirmed or suspected cases," said Newman. "This strategy ensures everyone who has been, or could have been, exposed to a patient with smallpox receives the vaccine." <br><br> Past that, however, the vaccines will not likely be widely used in the general public. "This is not something that everybody needs," Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, emerging diseases and zoonoses lead at the World Health Organization, said during a Q&A on social media. "It is a virus that is spreading between people who are coming in close contact with those who are cases."</p><br><br>
        <h2>Other Monkeypox Prevention Strategies</h2><br>
        <p>Even without a nationwide vaccination effort—which, again, is unlikely to happen—there are still ways to minimize your risk of contracting monkeypox. <br><br> Because the virus is spread through contact with an infected animal or person, or materials that have been contaminated with infected body fluids, the best prevention strategy is to avoid contact with any animals, people, or materials (bedding, clothing, towels) that could be harboring the virus. <br><br> And as with many other viruses, practicing proper hygiene is important, too. That means washing hands with soap and water, or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after potential contact, as well as using personal protective equipment. <br><br> If you think you may have been exposed to monkeypox—either through travel or close contact with an infected person—you should talk to your doctor as soon as possible and isolate from others to minimize risk of transmission.</p>

        <p>If you live an active lifestyle, you've probably tried (or at least considered) a pre-made protein shake at some point. The convenience of these drinks is pretty hard to beat when you need to recover after a workout or stay satiated throughout the day, but don't have time to whip up a full meal or snack. Finding the right option that has the ideal amount of protein for your needs (and isn't overloaded with added sugar) can be tricky, though, so we tapped dietitians to share their top recommendations.</p>

        <h2>Why you might consider a protein shake</h2><br>
        <p>Let's be clear: protein shakes are not typically a necessity. "In general, people who eat a wide variety of foods are meeting their protein needs," Brooklyn-based registered dietitian nutritionist Maya Feller tells Health. "With protein, more does not always mean better." Different people have different protein needs, and this is something that should be worked out with a doctor. According to Feller, individuals who are particularly active and looking to gain muscle may benefit from a protein shake with 20-25 grams of protein, while those looking to supplement their diet with additional protein can potentially benefit from a shake with 12-20 grams of protein. Kimberly Gomer, RD, LDN, director of Nutrition at Pritikin Longevity Center, stresses that protein shakes should not be consumed as meal replacements with the goal of weight loss. "The only time we say a good quality protein shake is a win is when our client needs immediate repair to their muscle—mostly [after] a heavier-weight workout—or if someone needs to gain weight," she says. <br><br> But protein alone isn't enough to refuel post workout. "Carbs and protein are equally important for muscle recovery," adds Kim Rose, a Florida-based registered dietitian nutritionist. So if you don't have time for a full meal, try pairing a protein shake with a healthy carbohydrate (like a piece of fruit) to balance it out, suggests registered dietitian Lauren Hubert.</p><br><br>
        <h2>What to look for in a protein shake</h2><br>
        <p>If there's one thing the experts all agree on, it's this: when it comes to protein shakes, you want to steer clear of added sugar. "Consuming a high amount of added sugar can be deleterious to anyone's health," Rose says. "It has been linked to unwanted weight gain, increased triglyceride levels, and type 2 diabetes." <br><br> In addition, you'll want to ensure you're getting the best source of protein from your shake. "It's important to seek out a protein base that contains the full spectrum of essential amino acids, which promote proper nourishment, satiety, and muscle recovery," says celebrity chef and certified nutritionist Serena Poon. Rose recommends whey and casein, which are complete sources of protein that can increase muscle mass, as well as soy and pea proteins for plant-based individuals. You can also opt for a protein shake with additional benefits, depending on your specific health needs. Registered dietitian and fellow at the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine Yulia Brockdorf tells Health that most whole food-based protein shakes contain some fat, and some keto shakes have added fats, which are ideal for people who want to feel a little more satiated. Ultimately, it's all about balance. "Incorporating a protein shake as a part of a healthy eating plan into any meal could be a healthy option," Brockdorf says. "It could also be unhealthy if used excessively and as a primary source of sustenance." <br><br> Along with the contents of the shake, consider the type that'll fit into your lifestyle, whether it's a loose powder that you mix in with water or milk, or a pre-made bottled shake that's easy to take on the go. Both forms can be blended with fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, too, though protein powders tend to mix better.</p>

        <h1>How Long Does a Sunburn Last—and Is There Any Way to Make It Heal Faster?</h1><br>
        <h4><i>Here's what dermatologists say to expect, plus sunburn-soothing products that can help speed healing.</i></h4><br>
        <h6>By <b>Claire Gillespie</b> <span class="text-secondary"><i>Published on July 6, 2020</i></span></h6><br>
        <iframe class="img-fluid" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brnZXQys7_E" title="How Long Does Sunburn Last? - Pain and Redness" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
        <p>Whether you forgot to apply sunscreen before spending the day outdoors or didn’t reapply the SPF often enough during a day at the beach, you might end up paying the price with a sunburn. How long will your sunburn last—and when will the redness, pain, blistering, and peeling finally subside? Here's everything you need to know, plus warning signs of a sunburn that requires medical attention.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is a sunburn, exactly?</h2><br><br>
        <p>“A sunburn, like a suntan, is the body’s defense mechanism against harmful ultraviolet (UV) sun rays,” New York City dermatologist Debra Jaliman, MD, tells Health. When skin is exposed to UV light, the body produces melanin, a dark pigment made by skin cells called melanocytes. Melanin is designed to protect skin, and how much a person produces depends on genetics, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. When people who produce less melanin are overexposed to UV rays, it causes damage to the DNA in the upper layers of skin cells—resulting in a radiation burn, known as sunburn. <br><br> Not everybody responds in the same way to sun exposure. In general, people with fair or light skin, freckles, or red or fair hair are more susceptible to severe sunburn, according to the American Cancer Society. But all skin types, from light to dark, are vulnerable to UV damage. The damage can occur on very sunny days as well as overcast days, because UV light penetrates cloud coverage.</p><br>

        <span>Photo: Getty Images</span><br><br>
        <h2>How long does a sunburn last?</h2><br>
        <p>How long a sunburn lasts depends on how severe the burn is, Connecticut-based dermatologist Rhonda Q. Klein, MD, tells Health. “Most sunburns will lose their associated pain and red tone in three to five days. But if you have a more severe, blistering burn, this could last for up to 10 days,” she says. <br><br> Pain from a sunburn usually starts within two to six hours of sun overexposure and peaks at about 24 hours. If you have a more serious sunburn, the skin may blister and peel. Blisters typically show up between six and 24 hours after exposure to the sun, but sometimes it takes longer for them to appear. Peeling of the skin is part of the healing process after a sunburn, and it tends to start after about three days. It should stop when the skin is fully healed, which can take several weeks in cases of severe sunburn. While the peeling occurs, resist the temptation to pick at it, which can cause further damage, says Dr. Jaliman.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Sunburn symptoms to watch for</h2><br>
        <p>Sunburn symptoms vary depending on the severity of the damage. If you have a mild sunburn, your skin will be red and painful. A moderate sunburn may also result in some swelling, and the skin may be hot to the touch. A severe sunburn typically has extreme redness and painful blistering, and it can be so bad it requires medical attention. <br><br> Call a doctor right away if you develop a fever along with your sunburn, advises, Dr. Jaliman. In severe cases, too much UV exposure may lead to shock, dehydration, or heat exhaustion, signs of which include extreme thirst, extreme pain, confusion, chills, and rapid pulse. Blisters that cover a large surface area may also require a doctor's care. Be alert for signs of infection in the blisters (pus, swelling, and/or tenderness).</p><br>

        <h2>How can you soothe a sunburn and make it heal faster?</h2><br>
        <p>Once you realize you have a sunburn, Dr. Jaliman recommends applying soothing aloe and hydrating shea butter. Make sure the aloe comes direct from the plant, or is fragrance-free, to avoid aggravation to the skin. If you have itching and inflammation, she advises using over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, which may also help to reduce any swelling.</p><br>
        <img src="Photos/Health/sunburn3.jpg" alt="Sunburn" class="img-fluid w-75"><br>
        <span>Photo: Getty Images</span><br><br>
        <p>To speed healing of peeling skin, Dr. Jaliman recommends holding a cold compress against your skin to cool it down, and applying moisturizer or plain petroleum jelly regularly for constant hydration. “This will help with the skin that is peeling and the skin that is trying to heal itself,” she says. Ditch the exfoliator until your skin has completely healed. The damaged skin will shed by itself, and the new skin is delicate and susceptible to irritation. <br><br> “Sunburn dehydrates you, so it’s important to drink plenty of water," says Dr. Klein. "Hydrated skin will recover more quickly." She also suggests taking a bath with colloidal oatmeal, an anti-inflammatory that offers relief from burning and itchiness. Always stay out of the sun until your skin is fully healed—or you could find yourself back with even worse sunburn symptoms.</p>
